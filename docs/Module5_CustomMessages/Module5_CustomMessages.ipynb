    "## Purpose\n",
    "This In-Class Exercise will provide you more insight into ROS messages and how information is passed between two nodes. A node can publish specific messages over a topic and other nodes are able to subscribe to that topic to receive the message. The format of these messages must be pre-defined and each node needs to know the format of the message. ROS provides a number of pre-built messages, but also allows for developers to create custom messages. In this lesson you will learn the method for and practice creating custom messages. In the corresponding lab you will develop a custom message to drive the robot. The custom message will eventually be used to enable a controller to drive the robot based on multiple data sources (e.g., IMU, LIDAR, keyboard)."

    "## ROS msgs\n",
    "### msg\n",
    "ROS utilizes a simplified message description language to describe data values that ROS nodes publish. There are a lot of built-in messages that are widely used by ROS packages ([common_msgs](http://wiki.ros.org/common_msgs?distro=noetic)). The *geometry_msgs* package is one example of a pre-built message which provides the *Twist* message type used to drive the robot in the previous ICE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom messages\n",
    "If a pre-built message type does not meet the needs of a system, custom messages can be created. A custom message is created using a `.msg` file, a simple text file that descries the fields of a ROS message. The *catkin_make* tool uses the message file to generate source code for messages. The `.msg` files are stored in the **msg** directory of a package. There are two parts to a `.msg` file: fields and constants. Fields are the data that is sent inside of the message. Constants define useful values that can be used to interpret those fields. We will primarily use fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fields\n",
    "Each field consists of a type and a name, separated by a space per line. The field types you can use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- int8, int16, int64 (plus uint*)\n",
    "- float32, float64\n",
    "- string\n",
    "- time, duration\n",
    "- other msg files\n",
    "- variable length array[] and fixed-length array[X].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Header\n",
    "The header contains a timestamp and coordinate frame information that are commonly used in ROS. You will frequently see the first line in a `.msg` file have a header.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "    Header header\n",
    "    fieldtype fieldname\n",
    "    \n",
    "For example, if we created a custom message file titled `Person.msg` that describes a person it might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Header header\n",
    "    string firstname\n",
    "    string lastname\n",
    "    int32 age\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Importing messages\n",
    "To utilize a *msg* in a node it must first be imported into the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist\n",
    "    from ice5.msg import Person\n",
    "```\n",
    "> ⌨️ **Syntax:**  `from <package>.msg import msg`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using messages\n",
    "After importing the *msg* you can access the fields similar to any object. For example, if we created an instance variable to store our Person message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person = Person()\n",
    "```\n",
    "You would then access the fields using the field names of the *msg*:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"%s %s is %d years old!\" % (person.firstname, person.lastname, person.age))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to set the linear x and angular z speeds of a *Twist* message before publishing it to the TurtleBot3 you would again use the field names provided by the pre-built message. If you googled the Twist message ([Twist Message](http://docs.ros.org/en/lunar/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html), you would see the contents of the Twist message include two other messages, linear and angular, of type Vector3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear\n",
    "    geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular\n",
    "    \n",
    "Each of those two messages include the same fields and fieldnames:\n",
    "\n",
    "    float64 x\n",
    "    float64 y\n",
    "    float64 z\n",
    "    \n",
    "To set the linear x and angular z values, we have to access those fields using an objected oriented method. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    from gemoetry_msgs.msg import Twist\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # create a publisher to send Twist messages over the cmd_vel topic\n",
    "    pub = rospy.Publisher('cmd_vel', Twist, queue_size = 1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # set the Twist message to drive the robot straight at 0.25 m/s\n",
    "    bot_cmd = Twist()\n",
    "    bot_cmd.linear.x = 0.25  # notice you have to access both the \"linear\" & \"x\" fields of the Twist message\n",
    "    bot_cmd.angular.z = 0.0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # publish the Twist message\n",
    "    pub.publish(bot_cmd)\n",
