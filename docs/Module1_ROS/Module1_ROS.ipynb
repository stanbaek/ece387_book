The TurtleBot3 is a tool we will utilize throughout this course to apply and integrate robotics systems.

But let's see if we can get the robot to drive around first.\n",

Gazebo is a simulation tool that provides physics for our robot and enables the testing of algorithms prior to real-world implementation.

Using the mouse, left-click and holding will pan, holding the scroll wheel will change the orientation of the camera, and scrolling will zoom in and out.\n",
