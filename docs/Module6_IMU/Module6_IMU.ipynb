    "## Purpose\n",
    "In practice, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) device provides orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration. The [ICM-20648 6-Axis MEMS MotionTracking Device](https://invensense.tdk.com/products/motion-tracking/6-axis/icm-20648/) from TDK includes a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and a Digital Motion Processor (DMP). This IMU is integrated on the OpenCR1.0 board, an open source robot controller embedded with an ARM Cortex-M7 processor. The OpenCR combines sensor data using an EKF to generate IMU estimates 170 times a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "![logo](Figures/IMU.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The IMU provides values that are part of the robot state and allow the robot to navigate more accurately. Combined with data from the tachometers these values provide the odometry of the robot to estimate change in position over time. We will primarily use the IMU to perform 90 and 180 degree turns.\n",

    "## Calibrating the IMU\n",
    "As described above, there are a number of different sensors that work together to provide the attitude and heading estimates for the Turtlebot3. These sensors are sensitive to magnetic fields which are unique to locale and device. As you will learn in future ECE classes, all electronic devices create small magnetic fields. Even electrons traveling over a wire create magnetic fields. The OpenCR board and IMU are strategically placed in the center of the robot for best attitude and heading performance, however, this location is also in the center of a number of magnetic fields. Luckily for us, the creators of the Turtlebot3 were aware of these issues and whenever you run the serial node to connect to the robot the IMU is calibrated."

    "Both of these topics provide the orientation of the robot using a quaternion representation. While quaternions can make computation easier, they are not very human readable, so we will convert to Euler angles.
