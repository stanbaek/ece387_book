    "## Purpose\n",
    "This In-Class Exercise will introduce you to utilizing pre-built ROS packages to accomplish a task. It will also provide you experience interacting with someone else's source code (.py files) to learn how that component works. You will use ROS to run two nodes, **turtlebot3_core** and **teleop_twist_keyboard**, to drive the Turtlebot3 with a keyboard. You will continue to practice using ROS tools to observe how these components communicate."

    "1. On the Master, open a terminal and run **roscore**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a new terminal on the Master and create a secure shell into the Turtlebot3 using the SSH command you learned during Module 2. This will allow you to run commands as if you were on the Turtlebot3.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the secure shell, open the source code for the **turtlebot3_core** launch using the nano command line editor tool through the rosed command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `rosed turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_core.launch`\n",

    "    > ‚å®Ô∏è **Syntax:**  `rosed <package> <filename>`\n",
    "\n",
    "    > üìùÔ∏è **Note:** You may remember when we set up our *.bashrc* file we set the system variable **EDITOR** to `nano -w`. This enables the `rosed` command to utilize the nano editor.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    We will learn more about launch files in a few modules, but just understand that a launch file is used to launch one or more ROS nodes. This paticular launch file only launches one node, **serial_node.py**. This node will connect to the OpenCR controller on the Turtlebot3 using the port and baud rate parameters. This connection will enable us to send *Twist* messages over the **/cmd_vel** topic to drive the Turtlebot3 using the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Close the editor by hitting `ctrl+x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is always a good idea to check that the Turtlebot3 is communicating with the Master. To do this, we can list the active topics the Turtlebot3 sees. Run the following within your secure shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `rostopic list`\n",
    "\n",
    "    If all is well, then there should be two topics provided by **roscore** running on the Master: **/rosout** and **/rosout_agg**. We will typically ignore these topics.\n",

    "    `roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_core.launch`\n",
