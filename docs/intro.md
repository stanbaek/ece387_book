# ECE 387 Introduction to Robotic Systems


## ü§ù Collaboration Policy:  

Unless  specifically directed otherwise, the collaboration policy for this course is:

- For all assignments in this course, unless otherwise noted on the assignment, you may work with anyone.  We expect all graded work, including cod and written reports, to be in your own work. Copying another person‚Äôs work, with or without documentation, will result in **NO** üö´ academic credit. Furthermore, copying without attribution is dishonorable and will be dealt with as an honor code violation.
- All help received on work submitted for grading must be documented in accordance with the course documentation üìù policy.
- GRs are individual efforts. No collaboration is allowed while taking these exams. All electronic devices (phones, smartwatches, computers, tablets, etc.) must be placed out of sight for the duration of the event. If any electronic device is seen during the event, the student will receive a zero for that effort. 
- While working on projects, you may collaborate only with your own team and with the ECE 487 instructor.  
- For graded homework assignments and labs, you may collaborate with any other cadet currently enrolled in ECE 487.  You may also reference the posted answers and solutions.
