Blocks can contain text or code, and for blocks containing code, press `Shift + Enter` to run the code. Earlier blocks of code need to be run for the later blocks of code to work."

However, it will work if you use the IP address (e.g., `ping 192.168.2.120`). To do this, you need the IP address of the machine you want to access. This IP address will change periodically. The easiest way to determine the current IP Address is, with the machine plugged into a monitor and keyboard, type `ip addr` in a terminal. This will list all of the network interfaces on the machine (such as *eth0* for ethernet and *wlan0* for wireless). You are looking for the `inet` field under `wlan0` (may be called `wlo1`).
