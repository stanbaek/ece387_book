    "## Part 1: Image Basics\n",
    "When we talk about the sizes of images, we generally talk about them in terms of the number of pixels the image possesses in the x(horizontal) or y(vertical) direction.  If the image is a color image, we also need to concern ourselves with the depth of the image as well.  Normally, each individual pixel is represented by the “color” or the “intensity” of light that appears in a given place in our image.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think of an image as a grid, each square in the grid contains a single pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most pixels are represented in two ways: grayscale and color. In a grayscale image, each pixel has a value between 0 and 255, where zero is corresponds to “black” and 255 being “white”. The values in between 0 and 255 are varying shades of gray, where values closer to 0 are darker and values closer 255 are lighter:\n",
    "\n",
    "![logo](Figures/Grayscale.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The grayscale gradient image in the figure above demonstrates darker pixels on the left-hand side and progressively lighter pixels on the right-hand side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Color pixels, however, are normally represented in the RGB color space (this is where the term color-depth comes from)— one value for the Red component, one for Green, and one for Blue, leading to a total of 3 values per pixel:\n",
    "\n",
    "![logo](Figures/RGB.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other color spaces exist, and ordering of the colors may differ as well, but let’s start with the common RGB system.  If we say the image is a 24-bit image, each of the three Red, Green, and Blue colors are represented by an integer in the range 0 to 255 (8-bits), which indicates how “much” of the color there is. Given that the pixel value only needs to be in the range [0, 255] we normally use an 8-bit unsigned integer to represent each color intensity.  We then combine these values into a RGB tuple in the form (red, green, blue) . This tuple represents our color.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To construct a white color, we would fill each of the red, green, and blue buckets completely up, like this: (255, 255, 255) — since white is the presence of all color.\n",
    "- Then, to create a black color, we would empty each of the buckets out: (0, 0, 0) — since black is the absence of color.\n",
    "- To create a pure red color, we would fill up the red bucket (and only the red bucket) up completely: (255, 0, 0) .\n",
    "- etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the following image to make this concept more clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![logo](Figures/RGB_Tuple.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "For your reference, here are some common colors represented as RGB tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Black:  (0, 0, 0)\n",
    "- White:  (255, 255, 255)\n",
    "- Red:  (255, 0, 0)\n",
    "- Green:  (0, 255, 0)\n",
    "- Blue:  (0, 0, 255)\n",
    "- Aqua:  (0, 255, 255)\n",
    "- Fuchsia:  (255, 0, 255)\n",
    "- Maroon:  (128, 0, 0)\n",
    "- Navy:  (0, 0, 128)\n",
    "- Olive:  (128, 128, 0)\n",
    "- Purple:  (128, 0, 128)\n",

    "\n",
    "The objective of this portion of the lesson is for you to start the process of learning how to create custom object detectors in an image.  There are many techniques, but the one technique I am interested in applying first is what is known as Histogram of Oriented Gradients.  Before we can dig into the technique, we should first understand a bit about image gradients and contours.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of today's lesson you will be able to: \n",
    "- Define what an image gradient is \n",
    "- Compute changes in direction of an input image \n",
    "- Define both gradient magnitude and gradient orientation \n",
    "- Use OpenCV to approximate image gradients \n",
    "\n",
    "The image gradient is one of the fundamental building blocks in computer vision image processing.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We use gradients for detecting edges in images, which allows us to find contours and outlines of objects in images.  We use them as inputs for quantifying images through feature extraction — in fact, highly successful and well-known image descriptors such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients and SIFT are built upon image gradient representations. Gradient images are even used to construct saliency maps, which highlight the subjects of an image.  We use gradients all the time in computer vision and image processing.  I would go as far as to say they are one of the most important building blocks you will learn about in this module.  While they are not often discussed in detail since other more powerful and interesting methods build on top of them, we are going to take the time and discuss them in detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned in the introduction, image gradients are used as the basic building blocks in many computer vision and image processing applications.  However, the main application of image gradients lies within edge detection.  As the name suggests, edge detection is the process of finding edges in an image, which reveals structural information regarding the objects in an image.  Edges could therefore correspond to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Boundaries of an object in an image. \n",
    "- Boundaries of shadowing or lighting conditions in an image. \n",
    "- Boundaries of “parts” within an object. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned in the previous portion of the lab, we will often work with grayscale images, because of the massive reduction in images.  OpenCV will convert to grayscale using the following conversion formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Y = 0.299 R + 0.587 G + 0.114 B$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see if that matches our expectations in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![logo](Figures/RGB_Gray.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The below figure is an image of edges being detected simply by looking for the contours in an image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![logo](Figures/EdgeDet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, all of the edges (or changes in contrast are clearly identified), but how did we do it?  Lets look at the math below, and then we will look at how simple the code is by taking advantage of OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, an image gradient is defined as a directional change in image intensity.  Or put more simply, at each pixel of the input (grayscale) image, a gradient measures the change in pixel intensity in a given direction. By estimating the direction or orientation along with the magnitude (i.e. how strong the change in direction is), we are able to detect regions of an image that look like edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at a blown up version of a basic pixel map.  Our goal here is to establish the basic framework for how we will eventually compute the gradient:\n",
    "\n",
    "![logo](Figures/PixelCont.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image above we essentially wish to examine the \\(3 \\times 3\\) neighborhood surrounding the central pixel. Our x values run from left to right, and our y values from top to bottom. In order to compute any changes in direction we will need the north, south, east, and west pixels, which are marked on the above figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we denote our input image as *I*, then we define the north, south, east, and west pixels using the following notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- North: $I(x, y - 1)$\n",
    "- South: $I(x, y + 1)$\n",
    "- East: $I(x + 1, y)$\n",
    "- West: $I(x - 1, y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, these four values are critical in computing the changes in image intensity in both the x and y direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this, let us compute the vertical change or the y-change by taking the difference between the south and north pixels:\n",
    "\n",
    "$G_{y} = I(x, y + 1) - I(x, y - 1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can compute the horizontal change or the x-change by taking the difference between the east and west pixels:\n",
    "\n",
    "$G_{x} = I(x + 1, y) - I(x - 1, y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Awesome — so now we have $G_{x}$ and $G_{y}$, which represent the change in image intensity for the central pixel in both the x and y direction.  Lets look at a relatively intuitive example at first without all the math.\n",
    "\n",
    "![logo](Figures/GradientEx.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left we have a $3 \\times 3$ region of an image where the top half of the image is white and the bottom half of the image is black. The gradient orientation is thus equal to $\\theta=-90^{\\circ}$\n",
    "\n",
    "And on the right we have another $3 \\times 3$ neighborhood of an image, where the upper triangular region is white and the lower triangular region is black. Here we can see the change in direction is equal to $\\theta=-45^{\\circ}$.  While these two examples are both relatively easy to understand, lets use our knowledge of the Pythagorean theorem to actually compute the magnitude and orientation of the gradient with actual values now.\n",
    "\n",
    "![logo](Figures/GradTrig.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspecting the triangle in the above figure you can see that the gradient magnitude G is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Therefore, all we need to do is apply the Pythagorean theorem and we will end up with the gradient magnitude:\n",
    "\n",
    "$G = \\sqrt{G_{x}^{2} + G_{y}^{2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient orientation can then be given as the ratio of $G_{y}$ to $G_{x}$. We can use the $tan^{-1}$ to compute the gradient orientation,\n",

By this point, we should all be well aware of what a histogram is.  The application of the histogram for the HOG feature extraction is to further simplify the tested image to enable our computer to rapidly and accurately identify the presence of an object within the image.  \n",
    "Instead of using each individual gradient direction of each individual pixel of an image, we group the pixels into small cells. For each cell, we compute all the gradient directions and group them into a number of orientation bins. We sum up the gradient magnitude in each sample. So stronger gradients contribute more weight to their bins, and effects of small random orientations due to noise is reduced. Doing this for all cells gives us a representation of the structure of the image. The HOG features keep the representation of an object distinct but also allow for some variations in shape.  For example, lets consider an object detector for a car, see the below figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![logo](Figures/HOG_Features.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing each individual pixel of this training image with another test image would not only be time consuming, but it would also be highly subject to noise.  As previously mentioned, the HOG feature will consider a block of pixels.  The size of this block is variable and will naturally impact both accuracy and speed of execution for the algorithm.  Once the block size is determined, the gradient for each pixel within the block is computed.  Once the gradients are computed for a block, the entire cell can then be represented by this histogram.  Not only does this reduce the amount of data to compare with a test image, but it also reduces the impacts of noise in the image and measurements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![logo](Figures/HOG_Histogram.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an understanding of the HOG features, lets use tools embedded within OpenCV and Dlib to build our first detector for a stop sign.  But first we need to download a pre-created repository of test and training data.  Remember, we won't use our training data to test the effectiveness of the algorithm.  Of course the algorithm will work effectively on the training data.  Our hope is that we can create a large enough sampling of test data that we can have a highly effective detector that is robust against new images."
