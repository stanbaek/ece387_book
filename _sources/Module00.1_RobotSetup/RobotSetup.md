# Robot Setup



This guide will walk through the steps to install Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS, ROS2 Humble, and all dependencies on a Raspberry Pi 4B. This Pi is then embedded within the Robotis TurtleBot3 Burger along with a USB camera. The robotics system, TurtleBot3, is utilized in the United States Air Force Academy's Electrical and Computer Engineering department to teach undergraduate students robotics.  

This guide is adapted from the [TurtleBot3 e-Manual](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/#overview).

## Hardware
Below is a list of recommended hardware and links. Other off-the-shelf components can replace the ones below. 

- [TurtleBot3](https://www.robotis.us/turtlebot-3/) 
- [USB Camera](https://www.adesso.com/product/cybertrack-h4-1080p-hd-usb-webcam-with-built-in-microphone/) (Any USB Cam will work, this is the one we use)
- 128 GB High Speed MicroSD card
- Monitor, mouse, and keyboard
- If using an older version of the TurtleBot3 with a Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi 3B+ you will need ot purchase a [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-8gb.html) (preferably with 8 GB of RAM))


### Hardware Assembly
Follow the [Robotis e-Manual](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/hardware_setup/#hardware-assembly) for hardware assembly stopping after installing the Raspberry Pi.


### Raspberry Pi
A Raspberry Pi 4 B with 8 GB of RAM is used throughout this curriculum. Ensure heat sinks are propertly installed on the Pi such as these from [CanaKit](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-heat-sinks.html).

Also, a small fan can be installed to help with cooling. We used this 3D printed bracket to mount the fan.

```


### Camera
After installing the Raspberry pi level of the TurtleBot3 you need to install the USB Camera Mount prior to finishing the robot build. The mount used in this course can be found in the [curriculum material](../stl/burger_usbcam_mount.stl) and is installed on two of the front standoffs on the TurtleBot3.

```{image} ./Figures/camera_mount.jpg

```

## Software

### Download Ubuntu and flash MicroSD card
There are multiple ways to download and install Ubuntu 22.04 to a MicroSD card, but the Raspberry Pi Imager is one of the easiest. Instructions for installing the imager on your operating system can be found on the [Raspberry Pi OS software page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). 

Once installed, start the imager and select the "CHOOSE OS" button.

```{image} ./Figures/installer1.png
:width: 540
:align: center
```
<br>
Scroll down the menu and select "Other general purpose OS".

<br>

```{image} ./Figures/installer2.png
:width: 540
:align: center
```

<br>

Next, select "Ubuntu".

```{image} ./Figures/installer3.png
:width: 540
:align: center
```
<br>
Lastly, scroll and select the latest 64-bit version of "Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS".

<br>

```{image} ./Figures/installer4.png
:width: 540
:align: center
```
<br>

Now that you have the correct image selected, you need to choose the correct storage device that corresponds to the MicroSD card. Select "CHOOSE STORAGE".

```{warning}
This process will overwrite the drive, so ensure you select the correct device! You can select "CHOOSE STORAGE" before inserting the MicroSD card, then insert it, and the card will be the new drive that pops up.
```

Once you are sure the correct drive is selected, click "WRITE".

Once complete you should have an Ubuntu SD card! Ensure your Raspberry Pi is powered off, connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and insert the SD card.


### Ubuntu Setup

#### Login and changing password
Once Ubuntu boots up you will be prompted to enter the login and password. It may take a few minutes on first boot to configure the default username and password, so if login fails, try again after a few minutes. The default username is **ubuntu** and password is **ubuntu**.

On first login, you will be prompted to change the password. Enter the current password, **ubuntu**, and then enter a new password twice.

#### Changing username (optional)
I like to change the username to "pi" so I remember that this machine is a Raspberry Pi. This is optional and you can change the username to anything you like.

First, add a *temp* user:
```bash
sudo adduser temp
```
Enter an easy to remember password, and then hit enter until you are back at the terminal prompt.

Add the *temp* user to the *sudo* group:
```bash
sudo adduser temp sudo
```

Log out of *ubuntu* user:
```bash
exit
```

Login to *temp* user account.

Change the *ubuntu* username to the new username:

```console
sudo usermod -l newUsername ubuntu
sudo usermod -d /home/newHomeDir -m newUsername
```

For example:
```shell
sudo usermod -l pi ubuntu
sudo usermod -d /home/pi -m pi
```

Log out of *temp* user and log in with new username and password (the password is still the same as the password you set for the *ubuntu* user).

Delete the *temp* user:
```shell
sudo deluser temp
sudo rm -r /home/temp
```

Now at the terminal prompt you should see `pi@ubuntu:` and if you type `pwd` you should see `/home/pi` (with `pi` replaced with the username you chose). 


#### Change hostname
If you have multiple robots on your network it is good to give each a unique hostname. We number each robot from 0-n and each robot has a corresponding hostname (e.g., robot0).

Change the hostname with the command line editor of your choice.
```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname robot0
```

Replace `ubuntu` with the hostname of choice, such as robot0. Save and exit.

The new hostname will not take effect until reboot. Don't reboot yet, though! We have a couple more things to accomplish before reboot.

#### Set up Wi-Fi
Until a desktop GUI is installed we have to work with the command line to set up the Wi-Fi. This is the most reliable method I have found and we will delete these changes once a GUI is installed.

First, determine the name of your Wi-Fi network adapter by typing `ip link` (for the Raspberry Pi version of Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS it is typically **`wlan0`**).

```bash
pi@ubuntu:~$ ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eth0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether e4:5f:01:15:5b:30 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether e4:5f:01:15:5b:31 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

Open the `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml` file in your favorite browser:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

Edit the file so it looks like the below (use spaces and not tabs) replacing **wlan0** with your wireless network interface and using your SSID and password:

Save and exit.

```
# This file is generated from information provided by the datasource.  Changes
# to it will not persist across an instance reboot.  To disable cloud-init's  
# network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:    
# network: {config: disabled}
network:
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            dhcp4: true
            optional: true
    version: 2
    wifis:
        wlan0:
             optional: true
             access-points:
                 "YOUR-SSID":
                     password: "YOUR-PASSWORD"
             dhcp4: true
```


Apply your changes using the following command:
```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

Alternatively, you can reboot your system and the changes will be automatically applied once the system boots.



**Optional:** It may be beneficial to setup a static IP address. To do this you need to determine your subnet and gateway.

Determine subnet and gateway addresses:
```
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ ip route
default via 192.168.0.1 dev wlan0 proto static 
192.168.0.0/24 dev wlan0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.0.201
```

Set static IP within subnet range:
```
# This file is generated from information provided by the datasource.  Changes
# to it will not persist across an instance reboot.  To disable cloud-init's  
# network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:    
# network: {config: disabled}
network:
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            dhcp4: true
            optional: true
    version: 2
    wifis:
        wlan0:
             dhcp4: no
             access-points:
                 "YOUR-SSID":
                     password: "YOUR-PASSWORD"
             addresses:
                 - 192.168.0.201/24
             routes:
                 - to: default
                   via: 192.168.0.1
             nameservers:
                 addresses: [192.168.0.1, 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]
             optional: true
```

#### Disable Automatic Updates
Ubuntu will attempt to apply system updates in the background. This has caused issues in the past with ROS dependencies and keys. Disabling automatic updates allows you to control when Ubuntu installs updates. While this is not a good habit for general computer security, it is fine for this application of an embedded robotics system. Ensure you periodically update and upgrade your system.

Open the auto updater configuration file using sudoedit:
```bash
sudoedit /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades
```

Change the content from:
```
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
```

to:
```
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "0";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "0";
APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "0";
APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "0";
```

#### Enable SSH and generate new keys
```bash
sudo ssh-keygen -A
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

#### Add Swap Space (optional)
The Raspberry Pi 4 B used in our course has 8 GB of RAM. Swap Space might not be necessary, but with a larger SD card it is beneficial.

You can check that there is no active swap using the free utility:

```bash
pi@ubuntu:~$ free -h
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           7.6Gi       201Mi       7.1Gi       3.0Mi       328Mi       7.3Gi
Swap:             0B          0B          0B
```

The **fallocate** program can be used to create a swap:

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
```

If it was created correctly, you should see the below:

```bash
pi@ubuntu:~$ ls -lh /swapfile
-rw------- 1 root root 2.0G Aug 19 17:30 /swapfile
```

Make the file only accessible to root by typing:

```bash
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
```

Verify the permissions by typing the following:

```bash
pi@ubuntu:~$ ls -lh /swapfile 
-rw------- 1 root root 2.0G Aug 19 17:28 /swapfile
Now only root user has read and write flags enabled.
```

You can set the file as swap space by typing the following:

```bash
pi@ubuntu:~$ sudo mkswap /swapfile
Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 2 GiB (2147479552 bytes)
no label, UUID=b5bc4abf-2bce-419e-870d-4d44a7a05778
```

Then turn on the swap file:

```bash
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

To verify that this worked you can type the following:

```bash
pi@ubuntu:~$ sudo swapon --show
NAME      TYPE SIZE USED PRIO
/swapfile file   2G   0B   -2
```

This swap will only last until reboot, so to make it permanent at it to the `fstab` file:

```shell
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

Now it is time to reboot by typing 

```shell
sudo reboot
```

#### Verify changes
After reboot and you log in your new hostname should be listed at the terminal (e.g., `pi@robot0`). Additionally, you should be connected to Wi-Fi and have an IP Address. You can confirm by typing the following and observing the IP address in the output:

![logo](Figures/wifi3.png)

You can now use this IP address to create a remote secure shell into the TurtleBot3 using either the IP address or hostname if your network provides Dynamic DNS. From another machine connected to your network type one of the following:

```bash
ssh username@IP_ADDRESS
```
or
```bash
ssh username@HOSTNAME
```

Lastly, ensure your swap space is still active by typing the following and observing the output:

```bash
pi@robot99:~$ free -h
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           7.6Gi       224Mi       6.5Gi       3.0Mi       903Mi       7.3Gi
Swap:          2.0Gi          0B       2.0Gi
```

#### Update and Upgrade
Since we turned off automatic updates, you should periodically update and upgrade. You can use this single command to accomplish both while accepting all upgrades:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
```

#### Install Ubuntu Desktop (optional)
A desktop GUI is **not** necessary for a remote machine like TurtleBot3 and will take up about 1.4 GB of RAM to run. If GUI is neccessary, the following will install the environment while confirming the installation:

```bash
sudo apt -y install ubuntu-desktop
```

If you do install the Ubuntu Desktop and want to use the GUI to setup the Wi-Fi network then you need to remove the settings included in the `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml` file. It should look like the original file when complete:

```
# This file is generated from information provided by the datasource.  Changes
# to it will not persist across an instance reboot.  To disable cloud-init's  
# network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:    
# network: {config: disabled}
network:
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            dhcp4: true
            optional: true
    version: 2
    wifis:
        wlan0:
             dhcp4: true
             optional: true
```



You can now use the GUI interface in the top right of the screen to set up a Wi-Fi connection.

### Setup GitHub SSH Keys
The following assumes you already have a GitHub account.

Create SSH keys to use with your GitHub account by typing the following using the same email as you GitHub login:

```bash
cd
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github@email.com"
```

When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key", hit **enter**.

At the prompt, type a secure password.

Start the ssh-agent in the background and add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Open the public key with your favorite command line editor (this is easier to accomplish via an SSH connection from a desktop machine with a GUI so you can copy the public key to your GitHub account).

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy the contents of the file (maximize the window and ensure you copy the entire contents up to the GitHub email).

Open a web browser and sign in to your GitHub account.

In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**:

<br>

```{image} ./Figures/ssh1.png
:width: 240
:align: center
```
<br>

In the user settings sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**:

<br>

```{image} ./Figures/ssh2.png
:width: 240
:align: center
```
<br>

Click **New SSH key**:
<br>

```{image} ./Figures/ssh3.png
:width: 640
:align: center
```
<br>

In the `Title` field, add a descriptive label for the new key, such as "robot0".

Paste your key into the `Key` field (contents of the `.pub` file).

Click **Add SSH key**.


#### Update Alternatives
Python3 is installed in Ubuntu 22.04 by default. Some ROS packages utilize the "python" command instead of "python3" so we need to create a new executable, "/usr/bin/python" that will call the Python3 (basically use the command "python" to call Python3):

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 10
```

## ROS2 Humble
At this point, the Ubuntu environment is setup. Now we will setup the ROS requirements for the TurtleBot3. All of these instructions are adapted from the [ROS2 Documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) and [The Robotics Back-End](https://roboticsbackend.com/install-ros2-on-raspberry-pi/)
. ROS 2 Humble is the latest version of ROS 2 that supports Ubuntu 22.04.

### Installation

Make sure you have a locale which supports UTF-8.

```shell
locale  # check for UTF-8

sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

locale  # verify settings
```

First ensure that the Ubuntu Universe repository is enabled.
```shell
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
```

Set up keys:

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Then add the repository to your sources list.

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ro
```

Install ROS 2 Humble:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install ros-humble-ros-base
```

The base version provides the Bare Bones of ROS 2 to include minimum packaging, build, and communications libraries. No GUI tools are installed. As the Raspberry Pi is embedded into TurtleBot it is ideal to keep overhead as low as possible. Many of the GUI tools will be ran on the main machine.

Install colcon (build tool)

ROS2 uses colcon as a build tool (and ament as the build system). When you only install the ROS2 core packages, colcon is not here, so install it manually.

```bash
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```


Setup ROS environment variables and setup scripts within the `~/.bashrc` file. If you don’t want to have to source the setup file every time you open a new shell, then add the command to your shell startup script:

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Any time you make changes to your `~/.bashrc` file you must source it:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Sourcing ROS 2 setup files will set several environment variables necessary for operating ROS 2. If you ever have problems finding or using your ROS 2 packages, make sure that your environment is properly set up using the following command:

```shell
printenv | grep -i ROS
```

Check that variables like ROS_DISTRO and ROS_VERSION are set.

```shell
ROS_VERSION=2
ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3
ROS_DISTRO=humble
```

## TurtleBot3 

ToDo: need to update this section for ROS2

```bash
sudo apt install libudev-dev ros-noetic-turtlebot3-msgs
cd ~/robot_ws/src
git clone -b develop https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/ld08_driver.git
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
```

### [ECE387 Curriculum](https://github.com/AF-ROBOTICS/ece387_curriculum)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:AF-ROBOTICS/ece387_curriculum.git
```

The **ece387_curriculum** package includes all dependencies needed to run the TurtleBot3 nodes. We can automatically install these dependencies using the ROSDEP tool:

```bash
cd ~/robot_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

This will take a while.

Now we can make and source our workspace:

```bash
cd ~/robot_ws
catkin_make
source ~/.bashrc
```

The last set of dependencies we need to install are Python dependencies. These are listed within our **ece387_curriculum** package and can be installed using the `pip3` tool:

```bash
roscd ece387_curriculum
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

> 📝️ **Note:** the "dlib" package will take quite a while to install.

### [Updating OpenCR firmware](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/opencr_setup/#opencr-setup)
The last step is updating the firmware for the OpenCR controller board.

Install required packages on the Raspberry Pi
```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture armhf
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libc6:armhf
```

Setup the OpenCR model name:
```bash
export OPENCR_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0
export OPENCR_MODEL=burger_noetic
rm -rf ./opencr_update.tar.bz2
```

Download the firmware and loader, then extract the file:
```bash
wget https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/OpenCR-Binaries/raw/master/turtlebot3/ROS1/latest/opencr_update.tar.bz2 
tar -xvf opencr_update.tar.bz2 
```

Upload firmware to the OpenCR:
```bash
cd ./opencr_update
./update.sh $OPENCR_PORT $OPENCR_MODEL.opencr
```

A successful firmware upload for TurtleBot3 Burger will look like:
![lobo](Figures/firmware.png)

If not successful, attempt the debug methods in the [OpenCR Setup](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/opencr_setup/#opencr-setup) guide.
