The **Grade distribution** for this course is shown in the chart below.

|     Grade             |     Grade           |   
|-----------------------|---------------------|
|     93 <= A <= 100    |     77 <= C+ < 80   |  
|     90 <= A- < 93     |     73 <= C < 77    |   
|     87 <= B+ < 90     |     70 <= C- < 73   |   
|     83 <= B < 87      |     60 <= D < 70    |   
|     80 <= B- < 83     |     0 <= F < 60     |   

_**You must complete all minimum functionalities on labs in order to complete the course.**  Even if an assignment is so late that no credit will be received, the assignment must be completed to the satisfaction of the instructor to prevent a grade of “Incomplete.”_

## Primary Communication and Control (C2)
All communication and course material will be provided through a course/section Team. A Blockboard course will be used to provide grades. Lastly, GitHub will be used for cadets to provide their source code for laboratories.

## Textbooks
There is no printed textbook for ECE 387. Reading materials/labs are posted on this Course Web.

## Collaboration Policy

Unless  specifically directed otherwise, the collaboration policy for this course is:

Authorized resources: Any material from the ECE 387 course site and online sources regarding C programming syntax only. This does not include any solutions or solution stubs for challenges similar to those asked in any assignments. 

- For all assignments in this course, unless otherwise noted on the assignment, you may work with anyone.  We expect all graded work, including code and written reports, to be in your own work. Copying another person’s work, with or without documentation, will result in NO academic credit. Furthermore, copying without attribution is dishonorable and will be dealt with as an honor code violation.
- All help received on work submitted for grading must be documented in accordance with the course documentation policy.
- GRs are individual efforts. No collaboration is allowed while taking these exams. All electronic devices (phones, smartwatches, computers, tablets, etc.) must be placed out of sight for the duration of the event. If any electronic device is seen during the event, the student will receive a zero for that effort. 

## EI Policy

Schedule EI with an instructor if you are having difficulty with the course material.  You must have read the assignment and attempted the homework before requesting EI.  Note:  You are responsible for material if you miss class, so get notes from someone in your section.  For example, you miss the lesson where the instructor announces a quiz for the next lesson or the instructor assigns homework due next lesson.  Even though you missed the lesson, you are still responsible for the quiz, homework, or any other assignments made.  It is in your best interest to check with your classmates after an absence.  After you’ve read the assignment, attempted the homework, and checked with your classmates, you may then schedule EI if you have difficulty with the material—not to make up a class you missed.

## CAS Policy  
For CAS notification, email your instructor prior to your absence and include the lesson number, the date, and the reason (descriptive reason — don’t just send a CAS code or SCA number) as soon as possible, preferably before the absence occurs.  It is your responsibility to check your SCA to see if instructor permission is required.  If it is, you must make the request prior to your absence.  If you miss class, you are responsible for all material (e.g. assignments, notes, announcements, handouts, etc.) covered in class.  Please check with another cadet in your section to find out what you missed.  

When a cadet is absent on the day that an assignment is due, or on the date of a quiz or GR, the cadet is responsible for meeting the following standards: 
- Scheduled Absence: If a cadet will miss any graded event due to a scheduled absence such as an SCA, sport team trip, or scheduled lasik surgery, the cadet is expected to complete all work BEFORE the absence.  
- Unscheduled Absence: If a cadet misses a graded event for an unscheduled reason such as AOC approved bedrest or a family emergency, the cadet must complete all work on the first full class day that they return to duty in order to avoid a late penalty.  For example, if a cadet is on AOC bedrest for a GR on M17 and can return to duty on T17 or M18, the cadet is expected to make up the work by M18.
- Unique Circumstances: For circumstances that do not fall under either of these broad categories (e.g. concussion protocol), the cadet is expected to communicate early and often with the instructor.  The instructor and course director will work with the cadet on a course of action.

## Late Work Policy
All work is due as shown on the [schedule](schedule.md) or in the assignment. If problems arise with graded assignments, see your instructor in advance.  Assignments turned in later than the due date **without prior permission** from the instructor will be penalized (with instructor discretion) 25% per **calendar** day.

## Assignments
Assignments and due dates are included on the [schedule](schedule.md). 

## Exams and Quizzes  
All exams and quizzes are closed textbook and notes.  Quizzes will be given at instructor discretion.  Testable material includes any concepts from the labs, lectures, exercises, homework, and assigned readings.  **Not all testable concepts will necessarily be covered in class (e.g., readings).**

For missed GRs, the following policies are outlined in USAFA FOI 537-3:
- Scheduled Absence - If you know that you will be unable to take the GR during the scheduled GR period, you are required to inform your instructor as soon as possible before the GR and to schedule a make-up exam.
- Unscheduled Absence - If you miss the GR for reasons beyond your control (e.g. hospitalization, emergency leave, delayed field trip return, etc.), you must contact DFEC (x3190) within two working days to schedule a makeup.  Exceptions can only be granted by the Department Head.

## Laboratories
Labs are held in 2E48 but may include a prelab assignment that must be done before coming to class.  The labs tend to be very hardware intensive and will probably require debugging to isolate and fix problems.  In-class time is your primary chance to get active help for these problems so the more you prepare outside of class, the more successful you’ll be.  The 53 minutes go by extremely fast - don’t waste them!

## Final Project
The final project will be a culmination of the learned material and will include a robot maze and competition. The final project will include a formal laboratory write-up and seven-minute presentation describing your design, solution, and results. The final project is worth 25% of your final grade.

## Miscellaneous
This course is designed to help in your development as an engineer or cyber scientist.  Feel free to provide feedback on the lessons and labs at any time.  If you have ideas to improve or enhance the course, please let me know.  The class builds on concepts from the prerequisites, so it is important for you to seek help as soon as you need it.   Procrastination is truly the enemy in a hardware design course.  A little foresight and planning and a lot of effort will result in an extremely rewarding experience serving as the basis for future microprocessor design work.
