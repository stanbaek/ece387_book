    "In this lesson we will enable the robot to avoid obstacles. Many sensors provide obstacle avoidance capabilities: camera, sonar, infrared, LIDAR, etc. All of these will work to enable the robot to avoid obstacles, but we will use LIDAR as it is an affordable, but very capable solution."

    "## LIDAR\n",
    "[Robotis's LDS-01](https://www.robotis.us/360-laser-distance-sensor-lds-01-lidar/) is a 360 deg Laser Distance Sensor (LDS). It is based on laser triangulation ranging principles and uses high-speed vision acquisition and processing hardware. It measures distance data in more than 1800 times per second. It has a detection range between .12 m and 3.5 m and an angular resolution of 1 degree. The distance accuracy is .015 m between .12 m and .499 m then +/- 5% up to 3.5 m.\n",

    "The robots for our class have two different LIDAR variants.  The older bots have the LDS-01 which is exactly what is pictured above.  The newer bots likely have the LDS-02 (pictured below).  If you have the LDS-02, you will need to go into the .bashrc file and change the last line in the file to indicate the proper variant.  \n",
