The TurtleBot3 is a tool we will utilize throughout this course to apply and integrate robotics systems. Ultimately you will create a complex embedded robotics system to perform a specific dedicated task, such as navigating the halls of DFEC. But let's see if we can get the robot to drive around first.\n",

Gazebo is a simulation tool that provides physics for our robot and enables the testing of algorithms prior to real-world implementation. You should see a TurtleBot3 sitting at (-2.0, -0.5) facing the positive x direction surrounded by a maze. Using the mouse, left-click and holding will pan, holding the scroll wheel will change the orientation of the camera, and scrolling will zoom in and out.\n",
