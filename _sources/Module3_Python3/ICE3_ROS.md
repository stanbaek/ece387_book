# Module 3: Python3 for Robotics
## In-Class Exercise 3 - ROS
Below you will run ROS commands. The "!" character in the front allows us to run bash commands from Jupyter and would **NOT** be used in the command line.

With the client and server nodes running execute the below commands.

List all running nodes:


```python
! 
```

List the active topics:


```python
! 
```

Display running nodes and communication between them:


```python
! 
```

Exit the rqt_graph.

Show information about a the **/client** topic such as what type of messages are sent over the topic and publishing and subscribing nodes.


```python
! 
```

Display information about the message that is sent over the **/client** topic.


```python
!
```

Display messages sent over the **/client** topic:


```python
!
```

In the ICE3_Client notebook when you send a message you should see the message echoed above.

## Checkpoint
Once complete, take the necessary screen shots of all the items above functioning. Upload those screenshots to your repo in a Module03 folder within the master folder of your repo.

## Cleanup
In each of the notebooks reset the Jupter kernel and clear output. Close each notebook. Shutdown the notebook server by typing `ctrl+c` within the terminal you ran `jupyter-notebook` in. Select 'y'.
