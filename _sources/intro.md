- Laboratory 🔬 work will be posted in this course web.
- All assignments must be submitted in [Gradescope](https://www.gradecope.com)
- [GitHub](https://www.github.com) will be used for students to provide their source code 📄 for homework and laboratory assignments.

## 🤝 Collaboration Policy:  

Unless  specifically directed otherwise, the collaboration policy for this course is:

Authorized resources: Any material from the ECE 382 course site and online sources regarding C programming syntax only. This does not include any solutions or solution stubs for challenges similar to those asked in any assignments. 

- For all assignments in this course, unless otherwise noted on the assignment, you may work with anyone.  We expect all graded work, including code and written reports, to be in your own work. Copying another person’s work, with or without documentation, will result in  **NO** 🚫 academic credit. Furthermore, copying without attribution is dishonorable and will be dealt with as an honor code violation.
- All help received on work submitted for grading must be documented in accordance with the course documentation 📝 policy.
- GRs are individual efforts. No collaboration is allowed while taking these exams. All electronic devices (phones, smartwatches, computers, tablets, etc.) must be placed out of sight for the duration of the event. If any electronic device is seen during the event, the student will receive a zero for that effort.
